      <h1 style="text-align:center;color:brown; font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: 22px">Dabong Railway Station</h1>

      <center><p style="font-family: Century Gothic ; font-size: 18px;" >The Dabong Railway Station is located in Kelantan's Kuala Krai District. The station was named after the town it serves, and KTM Berhad is primarily responsible for its operation. Dabong is a small town that is renowned for the nearby Gua Ikan (Fish Cave) on the Galas River. The town is also the primary access point to the Gunung Stong (Mount Stong) recreational forest and the Stong Waterfall. The Dabong train station provides KTM Intercity East Coast Line service between JB Sentral and Tumpat, Gua Musang and Tumpat, Dabong and Tumpat, and vice versa. There are only a handful of daily trips served at Dabong Railway Station, and the services are operating on schedule. The lengthy route between JB Sentral and Tumpat is only serviced once per day, with only two train stops in Dabong. Additionally, Dabong station serves as the terminus for the Tumpat, Dabong route, which stops at 13 stations along the way.</p></center>

      <h1 style="text-align:center;color:brown; font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: 22px">Fish Cave</h1>

      <center><p style="font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: 18px;" >Gua Ikan, which translates to "Fish Cave," is believed to be so-named because a stream flows through it, which may contain fish. Gua Ikan is a recreational park that is easily accessible. There are fundamental conveniences, easily identifiable landmarks and directions, and a good road route. There are adequate, clear, and noticeable signs present. The area will be ideal for caving, camping, and cycling because the camping grounds are large, flat, and situated in a secure environment. Enjoying the beauty of the flora and fauna is also a fascinating activity that can be performed there. This location has always attracted and been preferred by a large number of people, particularly civilians and possibly tourists.</p></center>
